# Introduction
From the foregoing, this assessment is somewhat pinned on Data Manipulations and Programming. Having mentioned that, it is considered important from my opinion to define the term Data Manipulation

**DATA:**
Data is important to human existence and decision-making process as Oxygen is to Human beings, apparently data have played a very important role from time immemorial which range from aiding record keeping that have shaped histories in variant cultures and belief systems to assisting in human civilization. Data indeed is the catalyst that drives every discovery.
Therefore, for the sake of this assessment DATA can be define as the smallest units of factual information that can be used as a basis for calculation, reasoning, or discussion. Data can range
from abstract ideas to concrete measurements, including, but not limited to, statistics.  

**DATA MANIPULATION:**
Data manipulation or Data Wrangling refers to the process of adjusting data to give it a constructive pedigree, enabling easy reading and understanding with the aim of gaining deeper insights or knowledge about the data to assist in personal or corporate decision-making. There should be no confusion between Data manipulation and Data manipulation language, the former as earlier defined is solely readjusting data by enriching, engineering, cleaning and normalizing aimed at achieving error free dataset to meet specific business objectives while DML is a programming language used on databases that adjusts data by inserting, deleting and modifying data in a database.
Having define data manipulation, letâ€™s get into answering the assessment.

## Second Step: Data Cleaning
After loading our dataset into python, our next task became cleaning our dataset to make sure missing values are replaced with arithmetic measures, duplicates rows or columns are deleted, 
outliers are taken of, feature engineering, feature enrichment and other necessary needed steps. This depends on the case in hand. Please find attached the python notebook code displaying every 
steps committed to this step.  

## Third Step: Defining our Class and methods
In this step, I defined a class AirBnB_renters: this encompasses AirBnB_renters as a business entity that is into hospitality and accommodations for their clients and with this Class definition we are able to know the facilities AirBnB_renters have in different cities to satisfy her client. 
Going forward I defined a method that categorize AirBnB_renters facilities based on room type and the year in which the facility where the room type located was constructed.
I defined another method that checks a client check-in ID for validation, before allowing access to facility. 
This program will surely enable AirBnB_renters to run business seamlessly and with ease. How? The total number of rooms available according to the room type and the year of construction can 
be known with a single click of a button. Also validating customer room booking ID before check-in is now swift thanks to the confirm check-in python method.
